# projects_schoolwork
Repository for schoolwork and projects

Code within this repository includes any assignments completed for courses that I have completed. Coursework included programming in C, C++, C#, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. For some of the assignments, code was provided by the instructor, and you will see appropriate credit given in the comment section of the code, where applicable.
Other code in this repository is linked to small projects I have developed using a Raspberry Pi, and are a combination of C, and Python. If you have any questions about the code, or you would like to contact me directly, I can be reached at steven.villano@gmail.com

Thanks for looking!
